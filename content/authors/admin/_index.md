Hi, I am an incoming Master of Computer Science student at [UC San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/). Currently, I am a Software Engineer Intern at [Intel NSG Data Science Group](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html). Recently, I graduated with honor from [Huazhong Univsersity of Science \& Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/) with B.E. Degree in Electronic and Information Engineering. Previously, I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Xiang Bai](http://cloud.eic.hust.edu.cn:8071/~xbai/) and [Prof. Wenyu Liu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=hVjCC4AAAAAJ&hl=en) with concentration on Scene Text Detection and Object Detection at [Vision & Learning Representation Group](http://www.vlrlab.net/). 

I have interests and skills in Web Development, Distributed system, Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Robotics. During my free time, I love to play fooseball and guitar.
